    <string name="intro">This app uses a new feature of Android Oreo called push-notifications. As a result of which the song control panel of the notification bar pops up when any changes are made to the song
playback. For eg. next song is played or the song is paused so that you can change
the song, play/pause while working on other apps without the hassle of opening the Echo app again
or pulling down the notification panel to do the same.</string>
    <string name="solutions">However some users might find it a bit irritating or a distraction. Hence they can always change that behavior by modifying the notification setting of the app by following the given steps :</string>

    <string name="help_1">I care for your privacy and this app doesn\'t access data from any directory other than the
        Music, Audio, Alarms and Ringtone folders that are meant to
    host audio files. In order to have a seamless experience make sure that all the song files are located in one of these
    folders.</string>
    <string name="help_1_1">As this is an offline music player, it only works with songs stored offline on your device in the Music or Audio Folder.</string>
    <string name="help1_q1">(i) Do you have audio files (.mp3,.wav,.wma) stored offline on your device?</string>
    <string name="help1_q2">(ii) Still not seeing any song file in the list?</string>
    <string name="help_2"> In order to have a seamless experience, it is recommended that all your music files are in the Music or Audio folders of your device.</string>
    <string name="help_3"> Some custom OS / OEM manufacturers use a different name for the folders storing music files
    In that case the app should still be able to find the song files for you. If in case, you still get a blank list of songs, you can manually create a "Music" folder without quotes in your internal storage\'s root
    directory and copy your music files there.</string>
    <string name="help_3_1">You can go to your file manager, navigate to internal storage, press the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the screen and select new folder.
    Name that folder as Music in the exact same style and copy your song files to that folder using either your file manager or by
    connecting to your device to a computer.</string>
